Work in progress:
  - Managing local volumes works.
  - Physical volume support comming soon.


Sample Usage:

node node01 {
	include lvm
	lvm::lv {
        "device1":
	        ensure => present,
            size   => "10G",
	        vg     => "vgStorage";
	    "device2":
	        ensure => absent,
	        vg     => "vgStorage";
	    "device3":
	        ensure => extend,
	        size   => "10G",
	        vg     => "vgStorage";
	    "device4":
	        ensure => reduce,
	        size   => "10G",
	        vg     => "vgStorage";
	}
}
